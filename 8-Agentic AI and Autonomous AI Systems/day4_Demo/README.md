# FinAdvise - Personal Finance Assistant
FinAdvise is a Streamlit-based AI-powered finance assistant designed to simplify personal finance management. It enables users to track expenses, access real-time stock information via the Alpha Vantage API, view budget summaries, and receive personalized financial advice through a conversational interface. Powered by LangGraph and the Groq API, FinAdvise maintains user context across sessions, provides empathetic and clear responses, and includes a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) mechanism for high-risk queries.
Features

User Profile Collection: Gathers user details (age, income, goals, risk tolerance) for tailored responses.
Real-Time Stock Data: Fetches stock prices using Alpha Vantage API with robust symbol extraction and error handling.
Intent Detection: Classifies queries into profile updates, stock queries, expense tracking, budget summaries, or advice.
Memory Management:
Short-term memory for in-session context (e.g., previous intents).
Long-term memory for cross-session continuity (e.g., past advice).


Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Flags high-risk queries (e.g., "liquidate retirement account") for simulated human review.
Empathetic Responses: Uses clear, jargon-free language for users with limited financial literacy.
Debugging: Includes logging to troubleshoot API issues.

Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
Virtual Environment: Recommended to isolate dependencies.
API Keys:
Groq API key (for LLM).
Alpha Vantage API key (for stock data).



Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository (if applicable):
git clone <repository-url>
cd finadvise


Create Virtual Environment:Create a virtual environment named env4:
python3 -m venv env4


Activate Virtual Environment:

On macOS/Linux:source env4/bin/activate


On Windows:env4\Scripts\activate




Install Dependencies:Install required packages from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

requests>=2.31.0


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys:
GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=<your-alpha-vantage-api-key>

Example:
GROQ_API_KEY=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
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=IG8T2GKRGV3DQSQ0

Usage

Interface: Use the chat-based UI to:
Check stock prices (e.g., "What’s the price of AAPL stock?").
Track expenses (e.g., "Add $50 for groceries").
Request budget summaries (e.g., "Show my budget").
Seek financial advice (e.g., "How should I save for a house?").
Share profile details (e.g., "I’m 30 and earn $50,000").


Example Prompt:What’s a good budget plan for someone my age who earns $50,000 a year and wants to save for a car?


High-Risk Queries: Queries like "Should I liquidate my retirement account?" trigger a simulated HITL response.

Notes:
Stock Data: Uses Alpha Vantage API for real-time stock prices. Free tier limits to 5 calls/minute; monitor usage or upgrade for higher limits.
Debugging: Check terminal logs for API response details or errors (e.g., rate limits, invalid symbols).
Security: Store API keys in .env to avoid hardcoding.
Troubleshooting:
Verify API keys in .env.
Ensure internet connectivity for Alpha Vantage API.
Upgrade pip if dependency issues arise: python -m pip install --upgrade pip.
